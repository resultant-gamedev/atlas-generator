Atlas Generator
===============

The Atlas Generator is a [Godot][godot] plugin which takes [Texture][texture]
as input and outputs [AtlasTexture][atex]s according to the sizes given by the user.

For example; If the user inputs an image with sizes 128x128 and inputs 64x64 as Width and Height to the plugin
it would generate 4 [.atex][atex] files from each corner of the image.
